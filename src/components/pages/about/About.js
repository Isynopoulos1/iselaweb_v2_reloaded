        <Description>
          <li> I'm Isela, a Product Designer and Frontend Developer that feels passionate for design, arts, and technology. </li>
          <li>
            With a background in digital, I've worked for over ten years in digital advertising agencies, where I had the chance to design for
            different international brands such as Paypal, Movistar, and Amazon.
          </li>
          <li>In 2020, I moved to Barcelona to jump into the technology field. </li>
          <li>
            My curiosity and interest in Web development took me to learn new tools such as HTML, CSS, SASS, and languages as Javascript with
            libraries such as React and Nodejs.
          </li>
          <li>One of the things that I enjoy the most is building sites and implementing a design system. üî∫ ‚óºÔ∏è üîπ</li>
