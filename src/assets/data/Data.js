      " Process:  First, I made my own logo using just the first letters of my name so it would be easy to recognize. Then I used Figma to make a blueprint of the website, including the site map, different flows, and reusable components for the code. I programmed the website with React and designed different elements like buttons, social icons, and cards that I could use to build the site. I also created a style guide for myself to make sure everything looked consistent and used code efficiently. Finally, I added a cool feature where you can watch videos by clicking on different cards.",

      "As a student of Web Development, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project called Flitter. It was an excellent opportunity for me to apply the web development skills I learned during the bootcamp. By creating a replica of Twitter, I learned how to build a full-stack web application that included user authentication, data storage, and a user interface.",
    challenges: "The team's goal was to create a clone of the popular social media platform Twitter.",
    user: " Individuals who enjoy using social media platforms, particularly those who are familiar with and enjoy using Twitter.",
    process:
      "Planning and ideation: The first step in creating Flitter was to plan and ideate the project. This involved discussing and brainstorming ideas with the team, identifying the key features and functionalities to include in the MVP, and creating a roadmap for development. Design and user interface: Once the ideation process was complete, the team focused on designing the user interface and user experience. This involved creating wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to ensure the app's design was intuitive, user-friendly, and visually appealing. Development: With the design and user interface in place, the team began developing the app's core functionalities, such as user authentication, profile creation, tweeting, following and unfollowing other users, and liking and disliking fleets. Testing and debugging: As development progressed, the team conducted extensive testing and debugging to ensure the app's functionality was consistent and free of errors. This involved using various testing methods, such as unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing. Deployment: Once the application was fully developed and tested, it was deployed to a public server. To do this, the server was configured and the application was deployed to the cloud using a database hosted on MongoDB Atlas, instead of on a local server. This ensured that the application was accessible to users and could be easily scaled if necessary.",

To bring this idea to life, I first created wireframes using Figma to map out the site structure and flows. In programming, I designed components including buttons, social icons, cards, and other elements that could be reused across the design. I also implemented lists of styles to reuse in the code. Furthermore, I created a map list to showcase various video content.",
